                My journey with RMA has been incredible so far. From day one,
                I’ve been working closely with my mentor, and I’ve learned so
                much about bioinformatics. The freedom to explore and the
                guidance I’ve received have really helped me grow as a
                researcher. I couldn’t have asked for a better experience, and
                I’m excited to see where this project leads.

                RMA has truly exceeded my expectations! Working with my mentor
                on our project about sustainable energy has been an eye-opening
                experience. We’ve already gathered some fascinating data, and I
                can’t wait to see how it all comes together. This program has
                given me the chance to connect with an expert in the field and
                explore econometrics, a topic I’m passionate about. I’m grateful
                for the opportunity to be part of this mentorship.

                When I signed up for RMA, I expected it to be a scam program
                because it sounded too good to be true. Now, I am thankful I
                made the decision to sign up because I never would have met
                Lucas Eddy, a graduate student who has guided my research. I
                would recommend everyone to apply because my experience has been
                positive.

                The RMA experience has been unique and different than other
                mentorship programs I have been involved in. They give way more
                independence by letting us work directly with the mentor with no
                intervention from them. I am thankful to RMA for this unique
                experience!

                My experience has been pretty good with RMA! We made contact
                with the professor and other members of our group and got to
                work immediately, finding topics, journals, reference articles,
                etc. which is a good direction to go in for sure! This has been
                a pretty cool program to find and join for sure and I’m happy
                about the opportunity, especially in a topic that I am very
                interested in. I am very glad to be paired with my professor and
                respect her and her work so I’m excited to see where it goes in
                the future!

                I was skeptical about how much I could learn from a virtual
                mentorship, but RMA has proved me wrong. My mentor has been
                extremely helpful, and we’ve already started drafting our
                research paper on climate policy. I love being able to work with
                my mentor and a group on our own projects. I’m really thankful
                for this experience!

                I would like to thank RMA for this opportunity. So far, research
                with Professor Giasseti has been going very well. We are about
                to begin writing our review based on topics like gene therapy
                and AI.{" "}
